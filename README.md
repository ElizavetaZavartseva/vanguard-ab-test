They have a wide selection of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.

Goals: 
1. Determine whether the new UI has resulted in a higher completion rate.
2. Determine whether the new UI has resulted in fewer errors.
3. Determine whether the new UI has resulted in a reduction in step time.

Data Overview:
In the begining there were 3 dataset, which had to be proccesed:
1. Removed Null values and Duplicates.
2. Standardize data into the correct format.
3. Merging data sets.

Performance Metrics:
1. Completion Rate - A high completion rate indicates that most users can complete all steps without interrupting the process, suggesting a user-friendly and efficient process.
2. Time Spent on Each Step - High number in the Time Spent on Each Step metric can indicate that users might find the step confusing, leading to more time spent figuring out what to do.
3. Error Rates - High error rates suggest that users are struggling with certain steps, which could be due to unclear instructions, complex interfaces, or unexpected issues.

Conclusions:

1. Completion Rate
Unfortunately, the completion rate did not meet the company's expectations. They were looking for a minimum 5% increase to justify the investment.

2. Time Spent on Each Step
We observed improvements in the test group, with reduced time spent on each step.For almost all steps, there was no significant difference in time compared to the control group.


3. Error Rates
The test version has significantly lower error rates, which implies that users make fewer mistakes and experience less confusion compared to the control version.
